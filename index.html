     <h4>  <p> I have been thinking about these for a little bit, because I could just make somthing and that would be so cool! And here are some other reasons why I should get a 3d printer.</p> </h4>
       <ol>
     <h4>  <li> I can sell the 3d printed models with my friends who also alreay have 3d printers</li></h4>            
      <li> If I sell them with my friends then I can pay my mom back with the money I make</li> </h4>
     <h4>  <li> if I get I a 3d printer, I won't just use it, the whole family will! everyone can!!!</li> </h4>     
    </ol>

     <h2> V bucks</h2>                    <a target="_blank"href=https://tech.hindustantimes.com/how-to/how-to-redeem-v-bucks-gift-cards-on-fortnite-mobile-xbox-and-playstation-71644836653794.html> <img src="fortnite gift card.webp" width="200" style="float: right;"> </a>

     <h4> <p>.... Don't judge me for wanting in-game currency! this one is good because it allows me buy things in fortnite, (skins, pickaxes, backpacks, gliders, emotes.) so its pretty good. Another reason buying V bucks is that if you get one gift card for 1000 v bucks, you can buy the battle pass (extra rewards for season). And There are enough v bucks in the battle pass to buy another battle pass, so if you buy one you buy all.</p> </h4>

    <h2> Small Drone </h2>               <a target="_blank"href="https://www.copter.bg/en/blog/how-to-take-care-of-your-drone">                                      <img src="drone-removebg-preview.png" width="200" style="float: right;"> </a>

    <p> The drone is not one of my top gift, but I still think it would be awesome to get. one reason I put it on this list was because I could send it around the house and annoy people. the second reason is I could fly it outside and fly it close to things like birds, or squirrels. The last reason a drone would be a good present is that smaller drones are pretty cheap.  </p>

   <p> I played the trumpet in 6th, and 5th grade, and i'm planning to play in high school. this one is good because then I can play at home, and I can also play with my friends, kyle who plays french horn, and sam who plays trombone. the last reason I should get a trumpet, is that I could play in a band, AND THAT WOULD BE AWESOME </p>

   <p> My sister got a mouse, My brother got a mouse, MY DAD GOT A MOUSE!! So it only makes sense that I get one. I like to play video games, and you can't do it with crusty, bad mouse. Another reason I would like a mouse is that I could use it for school, beacause I am used to a mouse not a touch bored,and that would make things much easier.</p>
